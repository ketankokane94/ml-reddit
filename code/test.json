  ^(Yes, we're a little behind the times, all the other subreddits have been doing it forever.
  But ours is going to be the best.)\n\nUnlike many subreddits that feature posts, our goal here is
  to highlight you, our users. Bernie and Bill Gates can afford their own Reddit Gold.\n\nIn that spirit,
  today we're going to take nominations for the following categories:\n\n• Best Question (that was answered)  \n•
  Most Awkward Question (that was answered)  \n• Funniest Question (that was answered)  \n• Best Unanswered Question
  \n\nAnd we will reluctantly do the obvious:\n\n• Best AMA  \n•
  Best Answer \n\nFor these last two we ask that you look for AMAs from people who really *got* Reddit,
  who provided an AMA experience that was above and beyond rather than just staying for an hour.\n
  \nPlease leave your nominations as a reply to one of the comments below, matching the category,
  and keep all other discussion to the comment labeled for it. Please note that if more than one
  person nominates the same thing for each category, we'll consider it the nomination that came first.\n
  \n**Prizes**:\n\nThanks to the generosity of the admins,
  we'll have some Reddit Platinum and Gold to hand out -
  Platinum to the winners of each category, and Gold to the
  Redditor who nominates each winner - so go dig out those top comments fast.
  I also have cool AMA stickers to send out to any of our winners or nominators who want them!\n",
